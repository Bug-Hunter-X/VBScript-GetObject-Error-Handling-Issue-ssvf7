This repository contains a VBScript code example demonstrating an uncommon error related to the GetObject function's error handling. The script attempts to retrieve an object using GetObject, and if it doesn't find it, creates it using CreateObject.  However, if CreateObject fails, the error is not properly handled, potentially leading to runtime errors later in the script when interacting with a Nothing object. The solution provides a more robust implementation with improved error handling and reporting.
